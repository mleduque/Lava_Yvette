@0    = ~Who are you...? Who am I...? What is going on?~
@1    = ~I cannot move, yet I see your face. I don't remember anything...~
@2    = ~Wow, a talking scroll! That's new.~
@3    = ~I only know your name, itâ€™s Yvette. I thought you were just a drawing...~
@4    = ~I guess your name is Yvette - there's a line that mentions it. I thought you were a simple drawing, when suddenly you started to move.~
@5    = ~Yikes! By the Gods, a talking scroll! (Throw the scroll away.)~
@6    = ~A scroll? What am I? Do you know my name? Please, tell me.~
@7    = ~"For my Yvette" is written on the scroll. I suppose that would be you. I'm not sure how to put this, but...you're a drawing.~
@8    = ~Forget it. I don't have time for this. (Throw the drawing away.)~
@9    = ~Yvette... Yes, I remember this name. It...it might be me. Thank you.~
@10   = ~What happened? Am I an enchanted scroll? Just some mage's creation?~
@11   = ~No, I...I don't think so. I see images, perhaps they are memories. I do not know what they mean.~
@12   = ~I think that you were like that for a long time. Nobody guessed that you might be something more than coal lines on parchment.~
@13   = ~I don't care who you are. Just tell me - can you do anything *useful*?~
@14   = ~I don't know who you are, lady, but perhaps time will tell. Maybe we can recover your memories.~
@15   = ~I'm not interested in who and what you are. Question is, can you help me on the road or in a fight?~
@16   = ~Will you keep me with you? I don't know why I woke up now, why you were given this scroll... You seem to be a good person. I would like to see your adventures.~
@17   = ~Perhaps one day I will live again, then maybe I will remember more. I do not believe I'll be forever like this - without limbs to move, without hands to touch.~
@18   = ~I mean you well, Yvette. Don't worry, I won't throw you away.~
@19   = ~Hehe, don't be so afraid, Yvette. Of course you may stay with us - there's no problem with that.~
@20   = ~I don't need another burden. (toss the scroll away.)~
@21   = ~(smiles) Thank you. I forgot to ask you your name. Please, I would like to know it.~
@22   = ~It's <CHARNAME>.~
@23   = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you, Yvette.~
@24   = ~Forget it. I'll take you with me, but you don't need to know my name.~
@25   = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@26   = ~It is a nice name. I like it. I think I have bothered you enough to<DAYNIGHT>, but I enjoyed speaking with you.~
@27   = ~Thank you. I will be here if you want to talk.~
@28   = ~I understand. I will remain with you as long as I can. Thank you for agreeing to bring me along.~
@29   = ~No...I do not think I can help you.~
@30   = ~I'm sorry. That was rude. It's just that I have no idea who you are...or *what* you are.~
@31   = ~I understand. Just forget the question. I'm a bit confused by all this.~
@32   = ~So I don't need you. (Throw the scroll away.)~
@33   = ~(You leave the scroll behind you and walk away.)~
@34   = ~Greetings, dear adventurer. Did you want to talk with me?~
@35   = ~I wanted to ask if you remembered anything. It must be...difficult...to lose your memory like that.~
@36   = ~You're just a useless drawing. What makes you think that I would want to talk with you?~
@37   = ~Of course, I always like to get to know my companions. I wanted to ask if you experienced any more memories.~
@38   = ~Unfortunately, I remember nothing more than I did when we talked before. All I have is the name you told me.~
@39   = ~I wish that I was more than a scroll, but I suppose I should be happy that I can at least speak with someone. It is better than remaining in a blank dream.~
@40   = ~This must be unusual for you. I mean, to speak with a face sketched on parchment. Do you like this kind of surprise?~
@41   = ~Adventurers have to face oddities in their lives, and besides, I like talking to you, Yvette.~
@42   = ~It is a bit weird, but I guess it could be worse.~
@43   = ~It is weird, and I don't like it. I don't want to talk with you.~
@44   = ~Oh, if there were colors on this scroll, how I would blush! Hmm, what does it mean, to compliment a drawing?~
@45   = ~Yes, it could be worse. I could be an ugly old hag!~
@46   = ~Just joking of course. Um...sorry, if that wasn't funny. I think in your place I would also be confused.~
@47   = ~I want to forget that I'm just a scroll, I think...~
@48   = ~It probably doesn't matter, but I remember that I liked to listen to stories. Could you...tell me one? Please?~
@49   = ~I would love to.~
@50   = ~If you want.~
@51   = ~Sorry, but we have to move, Yvette. Maybe later.~
@52   = ~You are so dull. I don't want to talk with you..~
@53   = ~I await. (smiles)~
@54   = ~In the middle of a clearing, there once lived a fair flower named Camila. She was no ordinary flower, she was harboring a dream to become a princess of the glade. She wanted to rule, to hold banquets for the roses and daisies, herbs and sunflowers, but her existence was the same each day. As time passed, her dream began to fade, until one day, a prince and princess came to her clearing. The prince made for his sister a crown of flowers, Camila among them. The flower never became a princess, but she made a princess laugh.~
@55   = ~Far away from this land, there grew a dark and silent forest. No birds called it home, no creatures walked below its lofty trees. It was said that black, evil magic ruled this forest. It was called Darkmoss, and few dared to enter it. One night a girl found herself lost in Darkmoss. Despite her fears, she woke safe and unharmed the next morning, and found that she liked the forest. She wandered through Darkmoss, playing, eating the fruits and berries she found there, and over the next few days, other creatures began to follow the girl. The first night, the fireflies lit the girl's way and the dragonflies flew about her. The next day, the rabbits arrived. From one girl's courage, Darkmoss began to live again.~
@56   = ~There was a young <PRO_MANWOMAN> who lived a tranquil life in a lonely citadel by the shore. But one fateful day, <PRO_HESHE> was forced from this peaceful existence and thrown headfirst into a world that <PRO_HESHE> had no knowledge of. At first, <PRO_HESHE> was terrified. But after many days spent adventuring, <PRO_HESHE> began to grow used to <PRO_HISHER> new life. It is said that this person saved the land from those who would bathe it in blood. <PRO_HISHER> noble actions saved the lives of many.~
@57   = ~That was a beautiful story. I am sure Camila was happy.~
@58   = ~It is a lovely story, and it shows how even the smallest actions can do good.~
@59   = ~A story about a hero... I like those. I wish I could meet that hero one day. <PRO_HESHE> must be an interesting person.~
@60   = ~I must sleep for a while. Thank you for the tale.~
@61   = ~What a pity, I think I must rest. Yes, I need it...~
@62   = ~I understand - you don't want to talk with me. I am sorry that I bothered you.~
@63   = ~Hello. Your story gave me a beautiful dream, <CHARNAME>. Isn't is fascinating that even a being like myself can dream? This one was... different, very different from what I used to see. Would you like to hear about it?~
@64   = ~Of course, Yvette. I like to hear your voice.~
@65   = ~All right.~
@66   = ~I don't want to talk with you.~
@67   = ~R-really...?~
@68   = ~Then I will tell you of it.~
@69   = ~You told me the story of this flower - Camila. She wanted to become a princess. As I said, I enjoyed that tale.~
@70   = ~I met her in my dream. You didn't mention what kind of flower she was, but I dreamed that she was a buttercup, small, fragile, but bright and cheerful. The weather was harsh, with strong winds and cold rains, but she ignored that - she faced it still hoping that her wish would come true. It must have been hard for her, but she never gave up.~
@71   = ~In my dream she didn't meet the princess. One night a beautiful silver-winged butterfly came to her, and they talked. "I am sorry, but most wishes never come true," said the butterfly. Camila told him that she knew, but she would never give up. She added that it was better to grow there and keep dreaming than it was to live without hope.~
@72   = ~The butterfly left her, and a few days later a woman came to the clearing. She plucked Camila from her comfortable place in the earth. "So it will end like this," the flower thought. But the woman was a sorceress, and she wanted to create a magical amulet. The sorceress put the flower inside a piece of glowing amber, and Camila found a different dream. She never became a princess of the clearing. Instead she became a beautiful gem.~
@73   = ~You know, I visited Darkmoss in my dream. It was terrifying at first, but it got better, just like in your story.~
@74   = ~I was thrown into the dark, humid forest. When I looked up, I saw only  the tall trees with their leafless canopies. I wandered through the Darkmoss, and not once did I meet a living creature. I began to worry. I noticed a silver spark at the edge of a clearing, growing larger as I walked on. As I reached the clearing, I realized that it was no spark - it was a woman, hovering in the air.~
@75   = ~"Who are you?" I asked the woman. She opened her eyes, unsmiling, and told me her story. She had been cursed by another goddess, this one long forgotten. "Can I help you?" I asked. "There must be a way to free you." For the first time, she smiled, then nodded. "If you wish to help me, you must read the name inscribed on the stone within this clearing. Find the village nearby, and tell them the name."~
@76   = ~I found the stone she mentioned and read the name. It's funny... I don't remember it now... However, I told the name to those who lived near the Darkmoss. It was the name of the goddess. Then the forest started to live again. I don't know if that gave freedom to the woman - I think yes. A moment later I woke up.~
@77   = ~I have seen the hero you told me about. <PRO_HESHE> was a marvelous person, noble and pure of heart. You know, <PRO_HESHE> looked like you. Interesting, isn't it?~
@78   = ~I have seen <PRO_HISHER> story. A childhood in the citadel, a best friend, a father. Everything was so real, it felt as though I was in the middle of it. Who was I in the dream? I don't know. I will never forget it - the seagulls that called as they soared on the wind, the crashing waves on the cliffs... I saw the hero's face once - before <PRO_HESHE> fell asleep, <PRO_HESHE> wondered if it was time to leave.~
@79   = ~At last <PRO_HESHE> left the citadel. I saw <PRO_HIMHER> weeks later, with several friends - a harsh but kindly elven woman, a bard who wanted to travel and learn more about the world, a mysterious elf who never told <PRO_HIMHER> their reason for joining the group... Only a few days later, they faced an evil creature - a wrathful spirit who wanted to rule the land as a tyrant. "You shall never prevail!" the hero taunted. The ensuing battle took two days, but the hero and <PRO_HISHER> companions at last defeated the creature. Then the spirit explained why it wanted to claim the land. Long ago, a past ruler of this land destroyed a temple dedicated to this spirit, slaying all who remembered its existence. The spirit wanted to avenge the fallen. After telling its story, the spirit died its final death, but that isn't the end of the story.~
@80   = ~The hero built a new temple for the spirit and those who had died all those years ago. I joined them, because I thought it was a good idea. We built a tower with a huge monument inside. Then the spirit's last priest arrived, and he could hardly believe his eyes! He remained in the new temple, aiding the adventurers who required it. The temple's tragic past was forgotten, put aside in favor of its glorious future. It was then a place of happiness, and a symbol of how fate can change.~
@81   = ~Did you like my story?~
@82   = ~Very much. I am a poor story teller compared to you, Yvette.~
@83   = ~It was unusual, but I enjoyed it.~
@84   = ~I think I fell asleep. Your "story" was dead boring.~
@85   = ~Of course you're not! Without your tale I would not have had this dream.~
@86   = ~Thank you for listening to me. I'm glad that you liked my story .~
@87   = ~Really? It was so boring...? I see... I won't bother you, then.~
@88   = ~I see... I won't bother you then.~
@89   = ~Hello, dear friend. It's a pleasure to see you again. (smiles playfully)~
@90   = ~Why, greetings to you as well, my fair lady. Are you willing to talk to me?~
@91   = ~I have absolutely no desire to talk to you any longer.~
@92   = ~Are you in the mood to talk, Yvette?~
@93   = ~Indeed, I am! To be honest... I have something I would like to ask you. Do you mind...?~
@94   = ~By all means, ask away and Iâ€™ll do my best to answer.  Who wouldn't answer you? You are just the...the... oh, I am sure you know what I mean.~
@95   = ~Actually, I wanted to ask you something. How do you feel about your life now?~
@96   = ~I *do* mind. Why would I want to talk with a picture?~
@97   = ~Are you trying to find out if you can make me blush? (laughs)~
@98   = ~I would like to ask you how does it feels...? I mean - the wind. Heh, it probably sounds silly, but... I remember nothing about...whatever I was before.~
@99   = ~It's like feeling the world moving around you. Sometimes it's just...wonderful. Other times, like in Icewind Dale, it's miserable and cold~
@100  = ~Wind is just...wind. Nothing special. It just happens.~
@101  = ~You are really annoying - you know that, don't you?~
@102  = ~Quite descriptive, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@103  = ~Ah, I can almost feel it on my skin. It would be marvelous to truly experience it, even in Icewind Dale. I do not think that I have ever been there, but it would be better than nothing.~
@104  = ~Really? Well, I think differently - it seems like it should be something magical.~
@105  = ~I don't know if I asked because it's something I can't experience now, or because I *did* experience it... Still, I think it's best to see the world as a magical place, dear <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@106  = ~Yes, that's what I believe in.~
@107  = ~You don't want me to ask a question? I think I can answer yours, though....~
@108  = ~It's hard to describe my perspective, my lord. Imagine that you stand in an empty chamber, its walls made of paper and with a single small window. It is like that. It's like a cage, but it used to be smaller. In the beginning it was so narrow that I couldn't move. Now it is different - it's bigger.~
@109  = ~I sleep on the floor, hoping that one day a door will appear. Maybe then I will be able to leave this place.~
@110  = ~You know - when I looked at you, just now, I realized that you are...kind. Not everyone would give me so much attention. If I had a body I would kiss your cheek, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You understand - to show how much I appreciate what you do for me.~
@111  = ~I'm honored to talk with someone as pleasant as you, Yvette. I don't need a reward for that.~
@112  = ~Thank you, Yvette. I bet you say that to all your friends. (Laugh.)~
@113  = ~I don't care. If you really cared, you would leave me alone.~
@114  = ~Hmm, someone here is quite slutty.~
@115  = ~You are a true gentle<PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>.~
@116  = ~Oh, of course! I have *plenty* of people to talk with. Oh, don't be silly, <CHARNAME>! You are my favorite person to talk with. (Yvette's bright smile is clearly directed at you.)~
@117  = ~That was rather rude. I didn't mean what you think I did.~
@118  = ~I will bother you no more, then...~
@119  = ~It is you... I... I think I remember something more about my past! It makes me feel such warmth... Lady Firehair. I remember Sune, the one I served. The Lady of Beauty! I am so glad after all of this...that I can remember something more than my name! You probably think I'm being silly, but... it's a marvelous feeling, finally remembering something.~
@120  = ~I don't think it's silly, Yvette. So you were a priestess of Sune?~
@121  = ~Cut down that idiotic behavior of yours, woman.~
@122  = ~I'm happy for you, Yvette. See? I told you that your memories will be back one day. You certainly sound happy about it.~
@123  = ~Yes - I am.~
@124  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You woke me from my dream - I don't know how. Only Sune herself may know that. Still, I am able to smile, to laugh again... My situation isn't as tragic as I thought. I used to see this scroll as my prison, but hey - I can still talk to you, see your world, hear the voices from the other side of this scroll. It could be worse, and now I understand that. I don't see this paper as a prison any longer.~
@125  = ~You are right  your body may be caged, but your mind and faith aren't, Yvette. You are a prisoner only if you believe that you are.~
@126  = ~You're still trapped in your little scroll - you can't even *exist* like a normal person. And you call this freedom? Don't make me laugh.~
@127  = ~Shut up. We need to get going.~
@128  = ~My fair lady, so long as you can smile, you are free.~
@129  = ~Exactly, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I couldn't have said it better myself. I am glad we agree with on this, <CHARNAME>.~
@130  = ~Laugh if you want, <CHARNAME>. I may be idealistic, but I prefer to see the world in bright shades rather than painted gray.~
@131  = ~There is something more. Whatever it is that separates me from my memories...it is breakable, I think. I believe that I may be able to leave this scroll, and become...part of your world. Just like your other companions, <CHARNAME>. What do you think?~
@132  = ~Your faith is really strong. I hope you do escape from your scroll.~
@133  = ~I would like that. I hope then that it will happen.~
@134  = ~You're ridiculous, you know that? A picture that thinks it could become a human! Ha!~
@135  = ~Done daydreaming? Good. The rest of us have things to do.~
@136  = ~I truly thank you for those words.~
@137  = ~You know, your life must be a sad one. You live with neither faith nor hope.~
@138  = ~I may stand there one day, gazing at the sky...~
@139  = ~Not "may" - you *will*. Don't doubt that, Yvette.~
@140  = ~Your optimism is almost as beautiful as you are.~
@141  = ~Enough dreaming. We have something more important to do.~
@142  = ~I see that I'm not the only optimist here. Thank you.~
@143  = ~Still trying to make me blush? Believe me - I would, if I could.~
@144  = ~But thank you.~
@145  = ~I had not thought that you were so rude.~
