@0    = ~Isn't this great, my lord? Irenicus is dead, and his sister, too. Now you're finally free, and I remain by your side. I never thought I'd become an adventurer...it's all so unbelievable! Just like the depth of my feelings for you.~
@1    = ~I couldn’t have come this far if not for your help, Yvette.~
@2    = ~Hehe. You know, I'm sure we'll fall into more trouble soon.~
@3    = ~(Smile)~
@4    = ~I'd prefer that you leave this team, Yvette. I'm sorry, but this is the end.~
@5    = ~You're always like that! You never cease to flatter, <CHARNAME>.~
@6    = ~I guess that's right. Our life is always like that, isn't it? Well, at least we're never bored!~
@7    = ~Hehe, you really have a kind smile, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad you show it so often.~
@8    = ~This is a strange place, <CHARNAME>. It's so quiet in here, it’s as though the trees are listening to what we say. It's so strange, those sculptures, those faces in the rocks, it feels as though they're looking at as.~
@9    = ~They're quite strange, indeed.~
@10   = ~Are you afraid? Hey, I'm still here. There's no need to worry.~
@11   = ~They're funny! Look, it's like an idiot's face. Just don't think about it, Yvette.~
@12   = ~I'm sorry, but I don't love you any more, Yvette. I think this is the end.~
@13   = ~(nods)~
@14   = ~You really know how to cheer me up, good sir!~
@15   = ~It's just a pity that Imoen isn't here with us. But no matter where she is, I'm sure she's fine.~
@16   = ~You know, I'm really glad your sister is here with us. She's a good girl, and I'm sure we'll become good friends.~
@17   = ~So, what should we do now, good <CHARNAME>? Shall we look for a city? Set up camp here?~
@18   = ~You know, those heads are really strange. I think I should check them out.~
@19   = ~I think I'll give a kiss to a nice girl who's standing in front of me. (Kiss Yvette.)~
@20   = ~We'll find a city, maybe some new work. I think adventuring has become my very profession!~
@21   = ~Whatever. You know, I've just realized that I don't love you any more. I suppose this is the end.~
@22   = ~Well, I think you know what you're doing, my lord.~
@23   = ~Ah, how casual, dear lord! (She kisses you)~
@24   = ~I'm happy, you know...~
@25   = ~I'll bet, dear lord! I think it's becoming my profession, too!~
@26   = ~I'm so glad that I can hide in your arms when I need it, m'lord. You are my shelter.~
@27   = ~Something happened? Why, I see sadness in your eyes.~
@28   = ~(Smile) Everything will be fine.~
@29   = ~I have to tell you something. I don't love you any more; it's the end. I'm sorry.~
@30   = ~What happened? Don't lie to me.~
@31   = ~It's nothing, beloved! Everything is fine. I just hope that we'll be fine together, that's all. But I should trust fate... hehe, and I should trust you!~
@32   = ~And again you know what I'm thinking! Hehe, is this another of your secrets, beloved? Godlike power to read the mind of the girl who loves you?~
@33   = ~I'm just worried about us, but I think I should trust you more...trust you and fate.~
@34   = ~However, now it's time for us to move, sir. I'm glad we still have some time to talk.~
@35   = ~You know, let's check those heads, thought they give me goose bumps...with their strange look. I'm just behind you, <CHARNAME>.~
@36   = ~So...the end? I...I can't believe it...I should have known it. I'll leave, then...I hope you'll be fine on the road...~
@37   = ~So, I guess it's time for us to part, my lord. I'm glad that I was able to help you with Jon Irenicus, that I stayed even a moment more than that, but from now on, I should focus on my own past. Maybe I can find the place, the people...You understand, don't you?~
@38   = ~Yvette, stay...please. I need your help.~
@39   = ~Will you stay, please?~
@40   = ~Have safe travels, then. Farewell.~
@41   = ~Whatever. Bye.~
@42   = ~I'm sorry, but I've already decided, <CHARNAME>. I'm sure you'll manage, you're a strong man.~
@43   = ~Farewell. Be safe on the road.~

@49   = ~(after a moment) Where am I? What happened?~
@50   = ~You fell to the ground, and weren’t breathing. How do you feel?~
@51   = ~You're...well...in Hell. You fell to the ground. I don't know why.~
@52   = ~Are you all right? Great, then were on the move. We can't waste any more time.~
@53   = ~I think I remember...~
@54   = ~I think...I think I was dead for a moment. I saw everything as though I wasn't in any particular place...everything was spiraling. I've seen from your eyes, from my eyes, from above us, and from inside my body. As though something wanted to take my mind and thoughts away from this place... but I grasped everything I could.~
@55   = ~It...it said to me...It said to me that my time is running out...that there's a limit to mercy, that...~
@56   = ~...that it's time for me to die again...~
@57   = ~What?!~
@58   = ~I don't understand. Can you tell me what you're talking about?~
@59   = ~But you're alive! You can't just die like...that! This is madness!~
@60   = ~Whatever. Feel better? Then we'll move on.~
@61   = ~It said that I have to die, that I was supposed to be dead, but I was given a chance...That I was lucky, that I was never supposed to meet you, to love and...(starts to cry)~
@62   = ~Don't you remember? I died, but then I came back to life, somehow...the painting Gabriel made gave me my memories, my heart and thoughts...Those of the real Yvette...~
@63   = ~It said that I have to die! That I was supposed to be dead, but I was given a chance. It said something about you...that I should never have met you, that it was simply luck...(starts to)~
@64   = ~So, was it Sune the Firehair who gave me the chance? Was it something different? I don't know...I know nothing! Why wasn't I supposed to meet you, why did it say something like that...~
@65   = ~But who is this "it" you mentioned? Was it one of the gods?~
@66   = ~Do you have any idea what we should do, Yvette?~
@67   = ~Come to me, Yvette. I won't give you up to that thing. You're a living person now, and you will stay like that. (Embrace her.)~
@68   = ~Whatever. I don't believe this stupid story.~
@69   = ~No...I don't think so...It was a kind of voice, as though it was Death itself...I have no idea. A god wouldn’t speak in his or her own voice. It was like many different voices speaking at the same time...~
@70   = ~No...I have no idea...Those voices...as though many people were speaking at the same time. It was so cold and...~
@71   = ~Those voices...as though many people were speaking at once...and this cold...What's happening?~
@72   = ~This is just too much! I can't stand it, do you understand? THIS IS TOO MUCH! Why is this happening...why?~
@73   = ~It'll be fine, Yvette.~
@74   = ~Just give me a break. Silence is all I ask. We have to go.~
@75   = ~Shh...Everything will be fine. I promise.~
@76   = ~Be strong. You're not a child. There must be a way.~
@77   = ~Fine? I can't understand why you're so sure of that.~
@78   = ~Be strong? That's easy for you to say...Why are you so sure that there must be a way?~
@79   = ~People always say there's hope, that everything will be fine. Do you remember our good times together? Everything that's good must end one day. Hope...Those from my village also had hope, but it didn't save them. They died...I died then...~
@80   = ~I suppose that this nightmare will come back until the day I just die again...~
@81   = ~I want to be alone now. Please, leave me, sir...~
@82   = ~So, that's who you really are...I...I'll try to walk. Just...let's go. In silence, please.~
@83   = ~(Yvette doesn't stand up. Now only a pale body lies on the ground: the corpse of a girl with chalk-white skin.)~
@84   = ~It's simply unfair...all of this. I wanted to see my present life as a gift from Sune. Now I’ll never know the real reason. It was probably just some kind of twisted joke that the Fates decided to play. Funny, isn't it? There's nothing to do but laugh...~
@85   = ~Yvette, there must be a way to stop this. Please, I want to see you as you were before the accident.~
@86   = ~Maybe it was only a dream, and the reason why you fell to the ground was a kind of...fatigue or...disease.~
@87   = ~So, you've found another thing to whine about. Marvelous. Bug off, all right? I'm tired of that.~
@88   = ~I know it's just a word, but please, remember hope. You should believe more.~
@89   = ~How? Do you even understand the situation? I don't know what I should believe in. I do love Sune, but what should I do now? Pray for mercy? I don't even know if it was she who gave me this so-called "second chance." On *second* thought, I think it's a *second* chance to die.~
@90   = ~What do you think? That I hit my head on the ground, and all I've seen was only my imagination? Do you even understand what's happening? I don't know what I should believe in. I do love Sune, but what I should do now? I thought that I was lucky, that I was given a so-called "second chance" to live, but now I see it was only...~
@91   = ~Do you want proof? Then take a look at my hand.~
@92   = ~Do you recognize the line? It looks like my previous form...That's not some kind of joke, <CHARNAME>. Soon, you may need a new companion. Someone will have to replace this false creation I'm now.~
@93   = ~You're not any creation, Yvette! You're a living person. I love you.~
@94   = ~What can I tell you? Don't surrender. I won't.~
@95   = ~(sarcasm) Yeah, so let's just sit down and wait for you to die. Great idea.~
@96   = ~You're weak. I'm tired of you, Yvette.~
@97   = ~So, what am I? You and I know no answer to that question, <CHARNAME>.~
@98   = ~What else should I do, <CHARNAME>? It's easy enough to say "don't surrender".~
@99   = ~Ah, I see you've become a person with a sharp tongue, good sir!~
@100  = ~I wonder...Maybe I should have stayed with Gabriel... in his perfect world. Then he'd be alive, and maybe then I wouldn’t have to die. Maybe that was where we should have lived.~
@101  = ~And forget about everything that made us happy? We'd never have made love.~
@102  = ~That hurt, you know that?~
@103  = ~What are you talking about? I love you, Yvette. Doesn’t that matter to you?~
@104  = ~Ok, that's enough. Leave me! Now!~
@105  = ~We were happy, I remember about that, but...Is this so easy for you? Can you just live with the thought that I could die soon?~
@106  = ~It's not that I want to hurt you. Just...you behave as though all of this was so simple. It's not just about us...I may die soon...Remember?~
@107  = ~No, I'm not sure I want to hear the answer. I'm not sure I want to talk with you about that. Maybe I should just stay silent. That'd be easier, without any pointless words, without shouting and making excuses...~
@108  = ~Yes, that'd be easier, but would it be right?~
@109  = ~Please, just don't turn into an Yvette I don't know. There *must* be a way.~
@110  = ~You're probably right, so stop bothering me.~
@111  = ~So, now you want to speak of my morality? Of my belief? I don't know the answer, <CHARNAME>.~
@112  = ~No, there's no way out of this situation. There's no way I could follow, <CHARNAME>.~
@113  = ~I'm not like you, a demigod. I'm a normal girl who believed she was given a second chance, and not so long after she's told that it's the end. It's like a dagger in my back. Do you think you'd act differently if you were in my place, <CHARNAME>?~
@114  = ~Maybe I'm not as ideal as you think I am. I'm sorry if I disappoint you. I think it's time for us to move. I'm sorry if that hurt. Truth and roses have thorns. I wish it wasn't like that...Oh, how I wish...~
@115  = ~How could you...~
@116  = ~Wait, let me take a sip of water.~
@117  = ~(Yvette looks a few years older than she is. You see the lines on her arm again. They looks as done with coal.)~
@118  = ~We can continue now. (cuts the talk and starts to walk)~
@119  = ~My lord, can we talk for a moment? Please?~
@120  = ~Of course we can.~
@121  = ~No, I'm fed up with your moods.~
@122  = ~Eh, yes...What is it? Want to take a stab at me again?~
@123  = ~I'm glad...~
@124  = ~Please, don't say such a thing, even though I know it's probably my fault you speak that way.~
@125  = ~I'd like to apologize to you...apologize for everything I've said to you. I should never doubt you, or the decision I made to stay with you. I don't know why all of this is happening, but it's not your fault. I don't think it's anyone's fault.~
@126  = ~It's fine, my lady. Anyone would react like that.~
@127  = ~(Say nothing and embrace her in your arms.)~
@128  = ~It's too late, Yvette. After the words you said...I don't love you any more.~
@129  = ~I think I understand, Yvette. I don’t blame you for what you've said...~
@130  = ~It's my fault, <CHARNAME>, but please would you hug me...? I need that...so much...~
@131  = ~(embrace her)~
@132  = ~No...I...I can't lie...honestly, I don't love you any more, Yvette.~
@133  = ~No. I won't.~
@134  = ~I'm sorry, I shouldn't, but now I feel better...when I feel you with all my senses. Thank you for not leaving me, good sir. I never dreamed I’d find anyone like you, even in my wildest dreams.~
@135  = ~I'd like you to do something. When I'm gone, please find someone who will take good care of you. A nice girl, who’ll fall for you just because of who you are. I want you to be happy for the rest of your life.~
@136  = ~Don't even ask me for something like that! I've already found the girl.~
@137  = ~I'll, but only if I can't find a way to rescue you. I'd prefer to stay with you.~
@138  = ~Of course I'll...~
@139  = ~I have to tell you something, Yvette. To be honest, I don't love you any more.~
@140  = ~I'm sorry. It's just a difficult thing to still have hope under these circumstances...~
@141  = ~That's something I'd wish for, but...you should understand that it may be impossible...~
@142  = ~Good...~
@143  = ~(gives you a kiss; her hands shake slightly)~
@144  = ~That's the <CHARNAME> I'd like to remember, no matter what happens. You're like a shelter to me. Do you remember when I told you about the "hideouts"? It was so long ago...~
@145  = ~Of course I remember! Gabriel made one for you.~
@146  = ~No, honestly. Can you tell me a thing or two about that?~
@147  = ~Yes, I do.~
@148  = ~It doesn't matter. To be honest...I'm tired of you. I'm sorry.~
@149  = ~I called the places where I could hide from the rest of the world hideouts. Something entirely for me, and maybe for one or two people I cared about and loved. I showed you a place once: a lake where I swam. It was such a gorgeous place...~
@150  = ~Gabriel made me a terrace, up in the tree, so I could watch the sunrises and sunsets. I really liked the place, but you...you made an even greater one. I have a hideout in your arms, a place where I can hide and forget about the rest of the world. Something of which even Sune'd be envious.~
@151  = ~(Smiles.) Well, I hope she didn't hear that. She'd be mad at me.~
@152  = ~I think she'd be proud of you. She's a goddess of love; she knows the feeling.~
@153  = ~So what? Even if I had to fight with Sune herself to rescue you, I'd do it.~
@154  = ~You should know something. I don't love you any more.~
@155  = ~I don't think so. She'd be glad you've changed so much.~
@156  = ~Hey! I'm the priestess of Sune, but you know more about love than I do...?~
@157  = ~Heh, I don't think you'll ever have to fight with Lady Firehair, my lord.~
@158  = ~I think we should go now. I'm glad we can smile at each other again...I hope it will sill last for some time...~
@159  = ~I...I should have known that...~
@160  = ~The...the feeling is back...I don't feel well...(She quickly sits down on the ground. She tries to take deep breaths, as though it'd save her, as though she was fighting it. Suddenly, she starts to scream as though something caused her great pain. She bursts into tears.)~
@161  = ~(A moment later, everything is plunged into silence, as though nothing had happened.)~
@162  = ~Are you all right? Yvette, say something!~
@163  = ~Silence at last. It's really annoying.~
@164  = ~(Hug her.) I'm here. I won't let it take you.~
@165  = ~I...I think I'm all right. I tried to stop it, but then a great pain hit me, as though cold talons had pierced my chest...as though it wanted to crush my heart and my will at the same time...~
@166  = ~(She hugs you, too.) Thank...thank you...I tried to resist this thing, but then I felt a great pain...as though cold talons had pierced  my chest...as though it wanted to crush my heart and my will at the same time...~
@167  = ~Will it keep coming back...until I just let my life go...? I can't imagine living like that for the rest of my life...if there's any life left for me...~
@168  = ~Of course there is. Hey, I'm a hero, remember? I'll find a solution.~
@169  = ~Can you trust me, please? There must be a way. We'll find it.~
@170  = ~I can't stand it any more. I'm sorry. Be silent and let's go.~
@171  = ~I'm sorry. I must be really terrible.~
@172  = ~(Suddenly, she smiles at you. She looks really cheerful.) This smile is for you, my lord. Take this as well...(She kisses your cheek.)~
@173  = ~Do you like it, sir?~
@174  = ~Of course I do! I *really* like it, my fair lady.~
@175  = ~Mmm...what an interesting change...~
@176  = ~Can I have an extra one here? (Point to your lips.)~
@177  = ~I'm not interested in any talks with you. Stand up and let's go!~
@178  = ~That's good, then! I'm happy as long as you are, my lord.~
@179  = ~Ah, of course. (She gives you a long and deep kiss on the lips.)~
@180  = ~That was nice, wasn't it? It's always nice to have you so near me, my lord.~
@181  = ~You're a beast...You have became just like your father...~
@182  = ~(Yvette sways on her legs; she's going to faint)~
@183  = ~(Try to catch her.)~
@184  = ~(Ignore her.)~
@185  = ~(You're fast enough to catch her before she hits the ground.)~
@186  = ~(You're too slow; Yvette falls to the ground.)~
@187  = ~I...~
@188  = ~I just can't stand it any more...It's too strong, <CHARNAME>. I suppose this is the end for me. Oh, how I wish I could stay with you, my good sir. I wish all of this...~
@189  = ~You don't have to say it. I know, Yvette. I feel the same.~
@190  = ~No! I won't accept it! This can't be the end!~
@191  = ~(Touch her face gently)~
@192  = ~I suppose, yes. I'm sorry I have to say it in these circumstances, but...I never loved you. It'll be better this way.~
@193  = ~I'm glad, my lord. You're always so kind to me.~
@194  = ~Shh, my lord. Just forget about what's going to happen.~
@195  = ~Your hands are so warm and kind. You're always like that, my lord.~
@196  = ~I'd like to tell you something. I was thinking a lot about all of this lately: about fate, us, and who I was before I met you. Now I understand something. It wasn't a second chance to live from the very beginning. It also wasn't a chance to walk, breathe...It was something else.~
@197  = ~I think it was a second chance to love. In my previous life, I never saw Gabriel as someone I could love. I focused on studying books about Sune, I focused on many different things, and I didn't notice that I never really felt true love. This was the second chance I was given...*you* are the chance. Now I may call myself a Heartwarder. I'd like to be able to protect you from all that's to come, but I can't. They say love can defeat death, but that doesn't mean I'll survive.~
@198  = ~But it really doesn't matter. Please, remember what we've seen together, what I told you. You're a good man, kind and gentle. You're playful, too...from time to time...~
@199  = ~You're the one who showed me how to be a real servant of Lady Firehair. We had some...less graceful moments, but life is always like that...isn't it?~
@200  = ~Indeed.~
@201  = ~Of course, my love.~
@202  = ~I'm sorry but no. I didn't have time before, but there's something...I don't love you any more.~
@203  = ~It's not life, but people. We're just like that, Yvette...~
@204  = ~I wish I could stay here longer with you.~
@205  = ~I won't let you go, you know it. Sune isn't cruel, she will understand that I want us to make this world brighter.~
@206  = ~You would suffer, you already do. Seeing you feeling like that would be a nightmare for us both, Yvette. We should remember those happy moments that are behind us.~
@207  = ~Would you pray with me? Would you ask her to give us some time, <CHARNAME>?~
@208  = ~Yes.~
@209  = ~I will do anything, m'lady.~
@210  = ~No. This is just stupid, she wouldn't listen.~
@211  = ~Just hold my hand, that will be enough.~
@212  = ~Sune, Lady Firehair, let us see another sunset. Let us have your blessing. Cast away shadows, cast away all the doubts and fill us with passion.~
@213  = ~Please...let me live for a time to give <CHARNAME> my whole heart along with my lips. Then I shall return to you. I beg you... I beg...~
@214  = ~It's fine, I am sure she heard your cry, Yvette. Now you should rest.~
@215  = ~How could you believe in this...farce? It's pointless.~
@216  = ~I'd like to give you something...I...I'm not as skilled as Gabriel was, but I'd like to give you a memento...something that will make you remember me. It's here in my bag. (it the portrait; sentence under it says "For my <CHARNAME>".)~
@217  = ~It's silly...the girl gives her own portrait to one she loves...I should have drawn you...I tried to draw you, but I couldn't capture your gentle face...I'm sorry...~
@218  = ~It's fine. Thank you. I like your silliness...(Smile.)~
@219  = ~Thanks to this, I'll never forget your marvelous smile.~
@220  = ~I'm sorry, but I can't take it...I don't love you any more.~
@221  = ~I've always been so silly, but I hope you'll remember me like that. I'm young, and there are still many things I've never learned, I've never seen...~
@222  = ~Could you kiss me, please?~
@223  = ~(Kiss her.)~
@224  = ~Of course. (Come closer to kiss her.)~
@225  = ~I'm sorry, but no...I...I don't want to...~
@226  = ~(Lines and shadows grow on Yvette's skin, her body changes, and you hear the sound of falling paper; she has turned into dozens of parchments with lines drawn in coal.)~
@227  = ~(She loses her breath and her body turns into dozens of parchments, and then into dust.)~
@228  = ~(She calls your name, falls onto the ground and her corpse turns into dozens of parchments, and then into dust.)~
@229  = ~So... so this is the end... I'm sorry I can't help you any longer...~
@230  = ~Thank you...~
@231  = ~So, here we are: yet another city before us. I just hope that...that it won't be like Saradush. I still have nightmares that we stand in the middle of Saradush, and the burning faces shout at us, blaming us for what happened.~
@232  = ~That won't happen again, Yvette.~
@233  = ~Oh, don't bother me with those kinds of problems.~
@234  = ~I don't think so.~
@235  = ~We can't know that kind of thing, Yvette.~
@236  = ~Mhm...(looks at the place)~
@237  = ~(She looks at you again) Did you say something? Is there something on your mind, lord?~
@238  = ~No...it's nothing.~
@239  = ~You look tired, Yvette.~
@240  = ~Yeah. Could you stop behaving as though you were the victim of malnutrition and seventy-seven plagues?~
@241  = ~I'd like to know if you feel all right.~
@242  = ~It's...it's all right. I think we should move on, <CHARNAME>.~
@243  = ~Yes, I suppose...I...I think I need to dream, but it’s not so easy lately...~
@244  = ~Eh, I can tell that from looking in my mirror...I think I need to dream, but it's not so easy lately...~
@245  = ~That's what you wanted to tell me? I don't understand why you even opened your mouth, then. Sometimes silence is golden, you know.~
@246  = ~We should move on. I'm not in the mood.~
@247  = ~(Whispers) Is this Sarevok? *The* Sarevok? The brother you killed long ago, before we met? Please, tell me it's only a dream. He's the one who murdered Gorion. The one who tried to murder you and your companions.~
@248  = ~The very same Sarevok, yes. We need an ally who'll help us with this new, very serious adventure, Yvette.~
@249  = ~Yes, but I think you've forgotten one very important fact. He isn't as strong as I am, so you shouldn't worry.~
@250  = ~Well, no, it's Queen Ellesime with a new hairdo. Of course it's him, Yvette. Are you afraid of him?~
@251  = ~Yeah, but just give this tone a break. You know, you should be more silent. Know your place.~
@252  = ~Well, I guess you're right. We need some allies to survive, but him...~
@253  = ~Well, I think you're right. You killed him once, you can do it again...~
@254  = ~Haha, very funny, mister <CHARNAME>. It's not that I'm afraid, but... I'm not sure I feel comfortable.~
@255  = ~However, I understand our situation. We're in Hell again, there are some new tests. I just hope you know what you're doing, good sir. I trust you. Still, that doesn't mean I trust this man.~
@256  = ~He's much different from the Sarevok I knew. The old man behaved as though he wasn't even listening to me.~
@257  = ~You don't have to. The moment he starts to behave in a strange way, I'll check what he's up to...again.~
@258  = ~Stop whining, Yvette. Know your place and be silent. I'm the leader here, not you.~
@259  = ~He's a bit different from the Sarevok I knew, but I'll keep an eye on him.~
@260  = ~People usually don't change so much in so short a period of time...But on the other hand, it's the first time I'm dealing with people like my good <charname> and this Sarevok. You know...I mean demigods.~
@261  = ~Maybe I'm not a girl who'd believe any of that man's words, but I think you shouldn't underestimate him, <CHARNAME>. If I were you, I'd prepare myself for anything.~
@262  = ~I probably shouldn’t give you advice on how to be a leader. I’m not very good at it!~
@263  = ~But I wanted to ask you something. When you brought him back to life, did it hurt? You fell to the ground, but I don’t see any change in you...you're still strong and...good-looking, I suppose.~
@264  = ~Of course I'm good-looking! Hehe, all us heroes are like that, you know!~
@265  = ~I'm fine, thank you. It was as though someone punched me in the face, but there was no pain. Strange feeling.~
@266  = ~Ah, so now you're worried. Just leave me be.~
@267  = ~What confidence, good sir! (gives you a kiss on the cheek) But please, don't become *too* confident. That'd be most unfortunate.~
@268  = ~I'm glad you're fine. When I saw you falling to the ground, I felt as though all my blood had froze instantly. It was a great relief when I saw you standing up!~
@269  = ~However, this place is a bit creepy. I didn't think we'd have to come back to it again. Don't you think the place seems really calm now?~
@270  = ~It wasn't exactly "full of evil creatures" before. Irenicus just made it a battlefield.~
@271  = ~Maybe Bhaal prefers his domain and any pocket planes that form to be quiet. Surprising.~
@272  = ~I'm fed up with your talking, girl. Can you at last be silent?~
@273  = ~It was never a busy place. It's just that Irenicus turned it into a battlefield.~
@274  = ~You're right.~
@275  = ~Indeed. I feel the same.~
@276  = ~When I look at this ground, see those faces on the facade, and when I smell this metallic-scented air...it just brings back memories of the last fight. It was an important moment...I knew that I'd have to fight by your side, and I didn't hesitate.~
@277  = ~But now the rush is gone, and we stand here in this place...I'm still sure of the feelings I have for you, but my courage...is gone.~
@278  = ~No, it's not. If you were really afraid, you'd already have run away. Courage doesn't mean you feel no fear, but that you can face it and follow the path you believe is right.~
@279  = ~I think I said it before: you're by my side, we're together, so there's nothing to worry about, Yvette.~
@280  = ~For Bhaal's sake, don't pee in your own armor, girl. Be silent now.~
@281  = ~(Kiss her forhead.) There I think that'll protect you, Yvette.~
@282  = ~Thank you for those words, my beloved. You're the greatest.~
@283  = ~That's why I love you, sir. I'm glad we're together.~
@284  = ~So, that's who you really are? Leave me...I don't want to look at you.~
@285  = ~So, this is the end. I never thought we'd find the Witch. She was so far away from Dream. She left him behind, but... Do you think what she did was really a bad thing? If she never did it, maybe she'd just...stagnate, and never change. It gave her some experience, and gave birth to new thoughts.~
@286  = ~I have no idea, Yvette. But life without dreams must surely be torture. Even nightmares are better than... nothing.~
@287  = ~Sometimes, what happens now doesn't justify what people have already done. I think this is a good example of that, too.~
@288  = ~I don't know, Yvette. I think we should go now.~
@289  = ~Indeed. Dreams do make a man.~
@290  = ~Your words are unnecessarily harsh, <CHARNAME>.~
@291  = ~I wonder what I'd do, were I in her place. I'm afraid I'd make the same mistakes, but maybe the end would bring me peace.~
@292  = ~However, I'm not her. Everyone has to carry his or her own burdens. Well, some people have helps in their family and friends. Maybe, if the Witch had had those, things would be different.~
@293  = ~But do you feel any different now? You don't have Dream inside you anymore.~
@294  = ~He's gone. You know, I really liked him, but I couldn't let him stay away from his creator.~
@295  = ~Yeah, and it's fine with me. I was tired of his presence. It made me feel uncomfortable, somehow.~
@296  = ~I'm sorry, but we don't have time for this right now, Yvette.~
@297  = ~I know what you mean.~
@298  = ~I guess that might be true... I mean, you had no time to yourself.~
@299  = ~But... doesn't she remind you of Irenicus? He loved Ellesime, and used to be an elf of Suldanesselar, but then... then he left it, because he thought that future might bring him something different.~
@300  = ~I think that maybe, if circumstances were different... To be honest, I think he was very much like the Witch we talked to.~
@301  = ~Probably, yes. If they made different decisions, everything would be quite different.~
@302  = ~We can't know what would happen under different circumstances, Yvette.~
@303  = ~Maybe. However, they made their decisions long ago, and we can't change the past.~
@304  = ~Mhm, however, we have to go, Yvette.~
@305  = ~Sometimes I forget about it.~
@306  = ~Mhm, you're probably right.~
@307  = ~You're right... However, we should remember that we're adventurers, not philosophers. So, my lord, shall we move on?~
@308  = ~Yep. You're right.~
@309  = ~You're right. We should move on.~
@310  = ~At last!~
@311  = ~Let's move on then, sir.~
@312  = ~Ah, so you didn't want to talk. You should have told me.~
@313  = ~I see... Let's move on then.~
@314  = ~This is the end, yes? Now we can leave this place...together. That's what you wish for, my lord, isn't it?~
@315  = ~Yes, Yvette. I love you. I want to stay mortal. I want to stay with you.~
@316  = ~Yvette, I should follow my heritage. I'm sorry, but I must leave you.~
@317  = ~I'm so glad! We should use time we were given. It seems I can stay with you, thanks to Sune, my lord.~
@318  = ~I am not sure how long this will last, but it doesn't matter. Even a single day is fine as long as you are by my side.~
@319  = ~I... I was afraid that something like that can happen. Finish it, then. Let this everything end. I want to... leave this place.~
@320  = ~What did you write about Yvette?~
@321  = ~What did you write about my beloved Yvette?~
@322  = ~Let me see...Ah, here it is!~
@323  = ~Yvette, a priestess of Sune: mysterious lady who appeared as suddenly as an unexpected dream. Young and with a cheerful smile, she's a fair companion. Innocent and trusting as a child, but that makes her even cuter.~
@324  = ~Excuse me?~
@325  = ~Is something not right, lady? Does this poet offend you?~
@326  = ~I'm not sure, honestly. Am I really so childish? Well...never mind...I guess I'm quite young, so I can be taken as someone like that, so it's nothing. Don't mind my digression.~
@327  = ~It's fine, little blossom. I guess you are who you are. It's a pleasure to see your smile in the flesh.~
@328  = ~Ah, the lady of your dreams...Where are those lines...Oh, here they are.~
@329  = ~Yvette is the closest companion of <CHARNAME>. She's the young, sweet and cheerful Heartwarder of Sune. Her innocent smile can cast black clouds away. Sometimes childlike, but that's what makes the heart glow brighter when she steps onto the stage.~
@330  = ~Thank you. Your words are very kind, Sir Volo.~
@331  = ~It's nothing. I have to say I'm envious of this Child of Bhaal. To have a nice companion like you... If you'd like to change your life, and decide to adventure with someone else, just tell me, lady.~
@332  = ~I'm sorry, sir, but this heart beats for someone else. I think I'll stay with this man for as long as Sune will bless us, but still, thank you again. You're very kind.~
@333  = ~Adorable! <CHARNAME>, you lucky guy...~
@334  = ~We can't go back now. We're here to fight with you and with fate. You may see us as some kind of insects, but we won't hesitate to bite you, Abazigal.~
@335  = ~Ah, I see there's a brave fly in this companion. Marvelous...it appears we'll have some splendid play here.~
@336  = ~This Balthazar must be a powerful man. All the people of this town appear to mention him, there are his soldiers on the streets...I think we'll end up as his visitors.~
@337  = ~However, you probably came to see my services.~
@338  = ~Listening to gossip may be a good idea, <CHARNAME>. There may be some real information in those kinds of rumors.~
@339  = ~Yep! Wow! What great equipment! I want to be like you one day!~
@340  = ~It's funny that those kinds of people appear out of nowhere and give us hints. I suppose it's what I'd call "Bhaalspawn's suprise magic."~
@341  = ~I see you've found a trustworthy companion, <CHARNAME>. That's marvelous, boy.~
@342  = ~It's a lich! Be prepared for all kinds of tricks, my lord. We've seen those of his kind before. We can't be sure if he's telling lies or truth!~
@343  = ~Be silent, child. I'd rather speak with the one who guides you.~
@344  = ~There's something not right in their voices. We should check what those people are talking about. Are they arguing?~
@345  = ~Just let me explain! She didn't do anything wrong!~
@346  = ~We can't let her go! If she escapes, something bad will happen! I'm sure of that!~
@347  = ~Nau! I can't die here this day! It's not the time...!~
@348  = ~This is a trap, <CHARNAME>. It appears something is going to happen again, but what? Look at her...Maybe she's here to avenge Irenicus...~
@349  = ~Stop babbling. I'm not interested in any kind of vengeance. I'm here to end a matter with <CHARNAME>.~
@350  = ~You will hit the ground, Yaga Shura! We won't let you win!~
@351  = ~I can't be defeated, little people! I'll win!~
@352  = ~No! Stop! He did nothing wrong, Gorion! Please, leave <CHARNAME> be! He's a good man. If not for him, I'd have died a long time ago!~
@353  = ~So, these are your new companions, my child? You walk with weak children? I gave you my best friends, I gave you Jaheira and Khalid, but I see at least one of them is dead now. <CHARNAME>, I taught you how to become strong, but still you decide to walk with this useless girl.~
@354  = ~Look at her hands: they are shaking. You force this poor child to face nightmares. She will have to face them every night, over and over again. That's what you want? That's the way you want to follow? That will cause you and her more pain.~
@355  = ~One day, she will end like me: she'll be murdered by a man, one of the Children of Bhaal. Leave her behind! Find someone better! Or maybe you'd prefer to stay here with me for a while...~
@356  = ~No! Why are you feeding us lies, Gorion? I thought you were different! <CHARNAME> still remembers you; he said you were a good man.~
@357  = ~Why do you still talk, girl? You should have realized this isn't the place for you...You should have left a long time ago. <CHARNAME> is a Child of Bhaal, and your card should not be in this deck. It's the story of a man, his siblings, and fate. Leave! Leave while you can still go back!~
@358  = ~Ah, your hands are shaking even more now. You know these words are true, don't you? Isn't it time for you to go your own way?~
@359  = ~I...I...I'll stay. My path is his path. I believe in him and I want to support <CHARNAME> with all my powers. If I must die, I at least won't bury my faith and honor now, Gorion. No...you're not Gorion any more. You're a mere shade of the person who used to live and love.~
@360  = ~You think you know so much, when in fact you live in an idealistic world of your own. So be it. You will die, sooner or later.~
@361  = ~Did you hear that? I thought I heard something in this house.~
@362  = ~It must have been an echo inside your hollow skull.~
@363  = ~Why is a single man guarding such a big entrance? I have a strange feeling...~
@364  = ~I'm not talking to you, girl. I'm speaking with your leader now.~
@365  = ~It's so clean in here. You must really like those books there. They appear to be in very good condition.~
@366  = ~It takes some time, but my books are worth the effort. Thank you, child.~
@367  = ~We're here to stop you, Gromnir.~
@368  = ~Ha! You really know how to make Gromnir laugh, little one. I'll crush you!~
