@0    = ~You came... you came, my dearest friend. Yvette, it is me, Gabriel! At long last, I can see you... I can look into your eyes!~
@1    = ~As I promised, you may leave... but she will stay. (Gabriel steps closer to the pond's golden water and uses it like paint to draw a door on the wall. The wall trembles, and the painted door opens like a wolf's jaws.)~
